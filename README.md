I enjoy creating digital products, trying out new ideas, and passing on the knowledge I gain to others.

This is the reason behind my creation of [Sieutoc Platform](https://github.com/websitesieutoc/platform), a Nextjs Starter Kit meant to facilitate a quicker SaaS launch.

I hope the boilerplate and other materials I created will help you in reaching your goals.

## Things I build:

- Pika Menu, https://pika.menu, a micro SaaS apps like  that help small and medium restaurant owners can turn their Google Sheets file into digital menus effortlessly.
- To be continued.
