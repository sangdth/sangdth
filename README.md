I enjoy creating digital products, trying out new ideas, and passing on the knowledge I gain to others.

This joy is the driving force behind my creation of a collection of starter templates and the development of open-source, self-hosted applications.

I hope that the materials I've created will act as catalysts, accelerating you toward your objectives quickly and effectively.

## Projects:

- [**Voi**](https://github.com/getsieutoc/voi), the minimalist self-hosted customer feedback app, heavily inspired by Canny.
