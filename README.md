I enjoy creating digital products, trying out new ideas, and passing on the knowledge I gain to others.

This joy is the driving force behind my creation of a collection of starter templates and the development of open-source, self-hosted applications.

I hope that the materials I've created will act as catalysts, accelerating you toward your objectives quickly and effectively.

## Open Source Projects:

- [**Voi**](https://github.com/getsieutoc/voi), the minimalist self-hosted customer feedback app, heavily inspired by Canny.
- [**Homie**](https://github.com/getsieutoc/homie), keep your domains tight, got your back like a homie in a fight.
- [**Platform**](https://github.com/getsieutoc/platform), a Nextjs Starter Kit meant to facilitate a quicker SaaS launch.
- [**Ninjutsu**](https://github.com/getsieutoc/ninjutsu), [**Taijutsu**](https://github.com/getsieutoc/taijutsu) and [**Genjutsu**](https://github.com/getsieutoc/genjutsu), 3 highly opiniate starter templates that cover most of your needs.

## Failed Projects:

- **Selling Stingless-bee Honey**, not related to tech, just selling.
- **DearMama**, a smart bracelet that can self-charge, designed for the elderly.
- **strawberry**, a framework that mostly uses SSE to update the frontend.
- **booksao**, rent a star (influencer, singer, dancer, etc.) for your event.
- **Fides**, a tribe-based (referral) social network where one member’s mistake gets the entire tribe banned.
